For convenience, each CMakeLists.txt in this directory is used to open a group of related maplab ros-packages in 3rd-party IDEs (such as QtCreator, CLion) in one-shot. You don't have to open all these packages one by one.

Before using the CMakeLists in this directory you need run the shell script "makelinks.sh" first.

This is only valid in Unix-like operation systems. It doesn't work for windows because windows lacks the support for soft-links of files.
